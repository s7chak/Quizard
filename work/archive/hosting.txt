App Hosting on Google Cloud Google Cloud offers a wide range of options for application hosting. Take a look at the charts below to find out which one is right for your needs. Use cases Not sure where to start? Take a look at some common scenarios below. HTTP services and backend apps Web frameworks, microservices Examples: Flask Django Express.js Symfony Spring Boot → Cloud Run Scales to meet sudden demand Pay for what you use Supports API endpoints Overview Event driven and data processing apps Manipulate user generated data and events Examples: Post a comment on Slack channel following a GitHub commit Statistical analysis Image thumbnail generation → Cloud Functions Designed for event-driven workloads Scales to meet sudden demand Minimal configuration Quickstart Container-based apps and services Industry standard packaging for multi-cloud infrastructure Examples: Custom runtime environments such as Rust, Kotlin, C++, and Bash Legacy web apps using languages such as Python 2.7, Java 7 → Cloud Run Supports industry-standard Docker containers Scales your containerized app automatically Custom binaries and system dependencies Supports API endpoints Quickstart On-premises and monolithic workloads Raw compute to meet existing infrastructure requirements Examples: Relational databases, SAP HANA CRM systems Legacy ERP systems → Compute Engine Operating system-level control Supports custom machine types Autoscaling support Tutorials Hosting options Many workloads have specific technical requirements. Platforms are ordered by degree of abstraction. Compute Engine Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Cloud Run App Engine flexible environment App Engine standard environment Cloud Functions Deployment format VM image Cluster App or Container App or Container App Function Custom URLs Scale-to-zero Free tier Persistent disks 2 Custom system packages WebSockets β Run any language Request timeout None None 60 minutes 60 minutes 1 minute 60 minutes Background processes ~ 4 GPU/TPU access VPC connectivity Managed event-driven architecture support 2 Container instances on GKE do not persist data upon shutdown. However, Compute Engine persistent disks can be mounted to container instances on GKE. 4 App Engine standard environment supports background tasks for basic and manual scaling modes. β Beta software has no SLA and may not be suitable for production workloads. Key terms Deployment format How is your code packaged upon deployment to a given platform? VM images - snapshots of an entire filesystem, including the underlying OS. Containers - portable cross-platform filesystems isolated from the underlying OS. Apps - one service contained in a directory with one or more use cases. Functions - individual code snippets each corresponding to a single use case. Custom URLs Can you create multi-layer URL paths (such as /abc/def) and/or use your own domain name? Persistent disks Can disk state be saved when an instance shuts down, or must long-term data be stored outside the instance? Scale-to-zero Can this product scale down to zero instances and avoid billing me for periods of zero requests? WebSockets Does this product support the WebSocket protocol? Run any language Can this product run code in arbitrary programming languages? Request timeout What is the maximum amount of time the platform will wait for a response from the application's code? Background processes Can this product run ongoing background operations outside a request period? Use GPUs and TPUs Does this product support hardware acceleration for GPU/TPU-optimized workloads? VPC connectivity Can this product access resources within a Virtual Private Cloud?
